      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started this show, the first 2 season were out already. AND I BINGED BOTH SO QUICKLY. It became of of those series I absolutely love (almost) everything about: the actors, story, setting, music, costumes, comedy. I even bought the first 2 seasons&amp;rsquo; OSTs in vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason though, I started season 3 when it was released, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get to finish it at that time. And then I went to Brazil, and was locked there for 5 months&amp;hellip; But coming back home decided to finally watch the second half of the season, and I loved it!!&lt;/p&gt;
