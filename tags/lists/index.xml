      <description>&lt;p&gt;The year is coming to an end, and Spotify released my 2020 rewind - or 2020 wrapped. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look on what I listened to this year. I saved the best for last, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Old AMVs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember many years ago (like, 2 decades) when I used to go to anime conventions and actually watch anime and AMVs. The 2000s were when the otaku culture was still beginning in Brazil, and internet and subbed anime was not common at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I remember a few AMVs that I used to watch from time to time, and get a really nostalgic feeling. I still have a CD with AMVs somewhere, all of them downloaded on Kazaa. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll find it and see what other videos it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, below I have a few AMVs from my early otaku days, 3 from anime, and 2 from games. Hope you enjoy! And leave a comment on the linked reddit post below, with your favorite AMVs ever!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
