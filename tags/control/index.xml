      <description>&lt;p&gt;After so many months without playing it, and then some time trying to beat it, I finally completed Control&amp;rsquo;s main story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I got stuck in the last battle, and after dying many times I stopped playing it for a while. A bit because of the frustration, but also because I got Fall Guys on PS4, and a Nintendo Switch with Animal Crossing and Streets of Rage 4. Then this week I decided to give it another try, and was pleasantly surprised with an update that added assist options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
