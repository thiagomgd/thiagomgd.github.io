      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been buying so many books recently, which I see as a positive: I already have more books than I would need for this year, so there&amp;rsquo;s no point in spending money just to expand my library. Although it&amp;rsquo;s nice to do that, it adds some level of stress overall, as I see that huge (mostly virtual) pile of books I want to read and are there, just waiting for me. I recently wrote about &amp;lsquo;backlog vs collection&amp;rsquo; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://geekosaur.com/post/geekosaur-weekly-3-collection-not-backlog/&#34;&gt;the most recent Geekosaur Weekly issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I want to share of what I&amp;rsquo;ve got recently, fiction books only.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I was very young, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big fan of good mysteries. I still remember when I first got The Hound Of The Baskervilles, by Arthur Conan Doyle. It was a delight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, fast forward to a year or so ago, and I was reading The Magpie Murders, my first Anthony Horowitz novel. I loved it so much, and I still need to write at least a short review here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that excellent first impression on an exceptional mystery novel, of course I was going to get another Horowitz novel. So I got The Word Is Murder, the first book on the Detective Daniel Hawthorne series, published in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Fiction Books I Got Recently [Nov. 2020]</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve got some sweet new eBooks on my Kindle, further increasing the size of my ever-growing TBR list. But, who can resist a sweet deal, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I&amp;rsquo;m sharing some of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired recently. It&amp;rsquo;s not everything, as some are free classic books, and some just not that interesting. Also, the list is still a bit big, so I left the non-fiction reads for a separate post. I guess I need to stop buying books for a while. Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
