      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;m here with some internet outrage agains Seven Seas, some cool articles on the anime blogosphere, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching and playing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about some Mushoku Tensei soundtrack, as the first topic of this week&amp;rsquo;s newsletter involves this franchise?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fall 2020 Anime - What I&#39;m Watching</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bit late to the party, but let&amp;rsquo;s talk seasonal anime. This is going to be a slow season for me, as I both behind in some titles, and reading/watching other non-anime stuff (and playing Animal Crossing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I can start with the things I&amp;rsquo;m behind, which is mainly 2: Re:Zero and Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?. For obvious reasons, I can&amp;rsquo;t start Danmachi&amp;rsquo;s 3rd season, even though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood for it right now, and Re:Zero is something that interests me more/has a higher priority than most seasonal anime for fall 2020. I should also add that I have all Sound! Euphonium movies in my backlog. whew&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Old AMVs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember many years ago (like, 2 decades) when I used to go to anime conventions and actually watch anime and AMVs. The 2000s were when the otaku culture was still beginning in Brazil, and internet and subbed anime was not common at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I remember a few AMVs that I used to watch from time to time, and get a really nostalgic feeling. I still have a CD with AMVs somewhere, all of them downloaded on Kazaa. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll find it and see what other videos it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, below I have a few AMVs from my early otaku days, 3 from anime, and 2 from games. Hope you enjoy! And leave a comment on the linked reddit post below, with your favorite AMVs ever!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Cosplays Do You Like To See At Conventions?</title>
      <link>https://geekosaur.com/post/cosplays-at-conventions-taking-pictures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve attended Aniventure, an anime convention I always enjoy going to, and I noticed one thing: I only took one photo.
My wife did take a few: some of us, another with two youtubers (just her and some friends, I was taking the pic) and, of course, the cosplay contest.
I&amp;rsquo;m not usually into taking pictures, and this got me wondering why did I take just that one.&lt;/p&gt;
