      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are a few weeks into summer 2020 season, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to talk about which anime I&amp;rsquo;m watching this time. Let&amp;rsquo;s see!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Old AMVs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember many years ago (like, 2 decades) when I used to go to anime conventions and actually watch anime and AMVs. The 2000s were when the otaku culture was still beginning in Brazil, and internet and subbed anime was not common at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I remember a few AMVs that I used to watch from time to time, and get a really nostalgic feeling. I still have a CD with AMVs somewhere, all of them downloaded on Kazaa. Maybe one day I&amp;rsquo;ll find it and see what other videos it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, below I have a few AMVs from my early otaku days, 3 from anime, and 2 from games. Hope you enjoy! And leave a comment on the linked reddit post below, with your favorite AMVs ever!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Cosplays Do You Like To See At Conventions?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve attended Aniventure, an anime convention I always enjoy going to, and I noticed one thing: I only took one photo.
My wife did take a few: some of us, another with two youtubers (just her and some friends, I was taking the pic) and, of course, the cosplay contest.
I&amp;rsquo;m not usually into taking pictures, and this got me wondering why did I take just that one.&lt;/p&gt;
