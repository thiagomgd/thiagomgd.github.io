      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I was very young, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a big fan of good mysteries. I still remember when I first got The Hound Of The Baskervilles, by Arthur Conan Doyle. It was a delight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, fast forward to a year or so ago, and I was reading The Magpie Murders, my first Anthony Horowitz novel. I loved it so much, and I still need to write at least a short review here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that excellent first impression on an exceptional mystery novel, of course I was going to get another Horowitz novel. So I got The Word Is Murder, the first book on the Detective Daniel Hawthorne series, published in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
