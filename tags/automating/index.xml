      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, Crow published an interesting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crowsworldofanime.com/posts/automating-blog-tasks-blog-shop-talk/&#34;&gt;post about automating blog tasks&lt;/a&gt;. That reminded me of a few things I have done but never shared here (or on one of my previous blogs), and I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to post them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back in time, about 6 years ago (I&amp;rsquo;m getting old&amp;hellip;.), and maybe 3 or 4 different blogs/domains, I was writing anime reviews as a way to practice my English writing skills. And part of doing anime reviews is getting images and gifs, right? At the beginning, I would go to reddit.com/r/anime, open the episode&amp;rsquo;s discussion post, expand all images (with the help of RES - reddit enhancement suite), scroll to see whatever I liked and grab it. But this is not optimal, and being a developer, I started thinking of something more practical.&lt;/p&gt;
