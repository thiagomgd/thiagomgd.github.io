      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time to talk about book I&amp;rsquo;m reading. On thing that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do is have a few &amp;lsquo;active&amp;rsquo; books, so I can have a change. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to split my reads in 3 categories: fiction, non-fiction, and learning. The list below is a good example of that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short science fiction book that also has a bit of fantasy. It&amp;rsquo;s the first in a series, but can be read as a standalone story.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time for a light novel review here. This is a pretty famous property and I remember the anime was popular when it aired, and nowadays it still has a big fanbase. I never watched the anime, although I was always curious about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a book series (duology) that is not that famous (I think) but worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
