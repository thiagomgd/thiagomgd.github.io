			<p>When I started this show, the first 2 season were out already. AND I BINGED BOTH SO QUICKLY. It became of of those series I absolutely love (almost) everything about: the actors, story, setting, music, costumes, comedy. I even bought the first 2 seasons' OSTs in vinyl.</p>
<p>For some reason though, I started season 3 when it was released, but didn&rsquo;t get to finish it at that time. And then I went to Brazil, and was locked there for 5 months&hellip; But coming back home decided to finally watch the second half of the season, and I loved it!!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xMcYofs.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There were a few things I didn&rsquo;t like so much, but overall, it was a strong season, even if not as wonderful as the first 2. I&rsquo;m still very excited for the next season and what is going to happen to everyone.</p>
<p>On a small note: I absolutely love the cast, and I think they are perfect for each role. With that being said, I stumbled upon this comment on Reddit:</p>

<p>I absolutely agree that Alison Brie would also be awesome as Mrs. Maisel. And I ask: there&rsquo;s any other actors you think could also have been great in this show? For which character?</p>
<p>Regarding some things I didn&rsquo;t like so much, or that I really liked, SPOILER ALERT. Stop reading if you didn&rsquo;t watch the season yet.</p>
<p>Episode 5: Lenny and Midget&rsquo;s &ldquo;date&rdquo;. I think it was awesome, and the characters and actors have such great chemistry. It would be GREAT if they got together, at least for a day/night. But unfortunately seems that Rachel Brosnaham begged the series creator not to have them together&hellip; I have 2 problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think the actors should interfere with the plot. If the creator and scriptwriters (and the audience) want, they should do it. She&rsquo;s working there to make what the creator/producers/director are envisioning.</li>
<li>WHY NOT??? Both characters and actors have great chemistry, it&rsquo;s clear that Lenny likes Midget. I think forcefully avoiding that is just forcing that relationship to stagnate into a platonic interest from Lenny&rsquo;s part. Which will just drift them apart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Last episode:</p>
<p>Ben and Midget scene at the diner: That was an incredible scene, and shows how Midge is egoistical and self-centered. I think that serves as 2 good life lessons for the audience.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are ending your engagement, do it in person. C&rsquo;mon, it&rsquo;s not like you saw the person for dinner twice. You are ENGAGED, the guy got a ring and a house for you.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t end relationships because you think the other person is not going to like/stand something. She hurt someone that really liked her, lost something that could have been an amazing relationship, just because she didn&rsquo;t ask him what he wanted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Midget&rsquo;s standup and being fired: WHOA. Yeah, the moment Reggie told her to talk about Shy, everyone saw that coming&hellip; That finale was heartbreaking, and now I&rsquo;m very curious to see what&rsquo;s going to happen in the next season.</p>
<p>Regarding the last scene, I&rsquo;ll leave this Reddit comment here</p>
