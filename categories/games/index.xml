      <description>&lt;p&gt;After so many months without playing it, and then some time trying to beat it, I finally completed Control&amp;rsquo;s main story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago I got stuck in the last battle, and after dying many times I stopped playing it for a while. A bit because of the frustration, but also because I got Fall Guys on PS4, and a Nintendo Switch with Animal Crossing and Streets of Rage 4. Then this week I decided to give it another try, and was pleasantly surprised with an update that added assist options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Notion.so was made free for personal use. One of the things I decided to use it to, is to organize my game&amp;rsquo;s list, mainly PS4. Not that I have a lot, but it&amp;rsquo;s still cool to plan what I&amp;rsquo;m going to play next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
