      <description>&lt;p&gt;My parents and I decided to watch some movies, instead of starting a new TV show, so we can enjoy the last few days of Telecine&amp;rsquo;s free trial. Check below what we watched this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Welcome To My New Blog</title>

      <description>Hello everyone! I have decide to move away from Wordpress and use Hugo (again).
This has some disadvantages, but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more control over the blog. And here won&amp;rsquo;t be ads on it.
There are no comments right at this moment, but I plan on using Reddit and Twitter threads as &amp;lsquo;comment platform&amp;rsquo;.
Please head over our dedicated subreddit r/geekosaur to chat. Also feel free to share cool content there!</description>
